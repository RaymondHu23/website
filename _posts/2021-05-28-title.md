Hello â€” my name is Raymond. I am currently a junior in [East Brunswick High School](https://www.ebnet.org/Domain/18) and Vice President of the [AYLUS Raritan Valley Branch](http://aylus.org/raritan-valley-nj/). I was also a member of the Central Jersey Math League (CJML) Team this year and plan to continue doing competition mathematics in the future.

In AYLUS, I focus on a virtual English tutoring program. Using Zoom, I communicate with overseas Chinese students and teach them English with a focus on conversational fluency. Fluent in both English and Mandarin, I can fill in any gaps in understanding and streamline conversation. In my lessons, I try to bridge the cultural disconnect between China and America by providing insights about American life and culture. I think it is important that we all learn more about each other and appreciate our differences, and the first step toward that is to break down language and cultural barriers. 

In the Math Team, I have been working hard to improve my mathematical problem solving skills. Last school year, I bought a math textbook to study precalculus not knowing it was a competition prep book. I've loved competition math ever since and resolved to join the Math Team as a junior. Late to the scene, I studied very hard to qualify but ultimately made it into my school's CJML team. I also got a 72 on the AMC 12 and hope to do better next year when I'm a bit more practiced. I have a lot more left to learn for competition math, but I'm having a lot of fun with it. I am very hopeful for the next year and hope to improve even more before then.

At home, I help my family however I can. My parents are frequently away, so I especially have to look out for my grandparents and two little brothers. I take phone calls and help fill out documents as a translator, and I help my brothers with schoolwork and tutor them in math. My parents also rely on me to draft emails and teach them Excel, PowerPoint, and other software. I feel bad for relying on my parents for so much, so I'm happy that my skills are needed in my household.

Thank you for your time and interest! To contact me, you can use any of the social media I have linked on the bottom of the page.

Hello â€” my name is Raymond. I am currently a junior in [East Brunswick High School](https://www.ebnet.org/Domain/18) and Vice President of the [AYLUS Raritan Valley Branch](http://aylus.org/raritan-valley-nj/). I was also a member of the Central Jersey Math League (CJML) Team this year and plan to continue doing competition mathematics in the future.

In AYLUS, I focus on a virtual English tutoring program. Using Zoom, I communicate with overseas Chinese students and teach them English with a focus on conversational fluency. Fluent in both English and Mandarin, I can fill in any gaps in understanding and streamline conversation. In my lessons, I try to bridge the cultural disconnect between China and America by providing insights about American life and culture. I think it is important that we all learn more about each other and appreciate our differences, and the first step toward that is to break down language and cultural barriers. 

In the Math Team, I have been working hard to improve my mathematical problem solving skills. Last school year, I bought a math textbook to study precalculus (to supplement my Algebra II class), not knowing it was a competition prep book. I've been enamored with competition math ever since, and resolved to join the Math Team as a junior. Late to the scene, I studied very hard to qualify, but ultimately made it into my school's CJML team. I have a lot more left to learn for competition math, but I'm having a lot of fun with it. I am very hopeful for the next year and hope to improve even more before then.

At home, I have a lot of responsibilities to shoulder. My father had to move to a different state to find a job and my mother returns home very late. Her previous job as a tour guide kept her out of the house for weeks at a time. In my parents' absence, I take over their roles, looking out for my grandparents and two brothers. I often have to take phone calls as a translator, requiring me to stay informed about the specifics of my grandparents' medical conditions and needs. I also tutor my two brothers and help them with schoolwork. However, as the only person in my family fluent in English and computer skills, I am needed for a variety of issues even when my parents are home. Although I love to give back to my family, the extra work can be a bit exxhausting.

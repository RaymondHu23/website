Hello â€” my name is Raymond. I am currently a junior in [East Brunswick High School](https://www.ebnet.org/Domain/18) and Vice President of the [AYLUS Raritan Valley Branch](http://aylus.org/raritan-valley-nj/). I was also a member of the Central Jersey Math League Team this year.

In AYLUS, I focus on a virtual English tutoring program. Using Zoom, I communicate with overseas Chinese students and teach them English with a focus on conversational fluency. Fluent in both English and Mandarin, I can fill in any gaps in understanding and streamline conversation. In my lessons, I try to bridge the cultural disconnect between China and America by providing insights about American life and culture. I think it is important that we all learn more about each other and appreciate our differences, and the first step toward that is to break down language and cultural barriers.
